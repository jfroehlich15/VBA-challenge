# VBA-challenge


Summary Data Code.bas includes the vba macro that runs through all rows and pulls the data for all tickers through every worksheet in the excel and adds it to colums I-L

Summary Table Code.bas includes the vba macro that runs through all rows from the summary data and pulls the greatest % increase, greates % decrease, and greatest total v=volume data to be added to the summary table in colums O-Q

I have also added the complete excel files that includes the same macros as the base files
