Summary Data Code.bas includes the vba macro that runs through all rows and pulls the data for all tickers through every worksheet in the excel and adds it to colums I-L

Summary Table Code.bas includes the vba macro that runs through all rows from the summary data and pulls the greatest % increase, greates % decrease, and greatest total v=volume data to be added to the summary table in colums O-Q

    Code to call max and min in each worksheet on Summary Table Code.bas sourced from Stack Overflow

I have also added the complete excel files that includes the same macros as the base files

PNG files include three screenshots of the three sheets on the complete excel file and the data that has been run through the macros
